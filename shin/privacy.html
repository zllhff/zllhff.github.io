    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>shin. ("the app", "we", "us") is a personal awareness and intentionality app for iOS. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>
    <p><strong>The short version: We don't collect your data. Everything stays on your device.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>shin. does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. The app operates entirely offline. No user accounts are required.</p>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The following data is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's CoreData framework:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Journal entries and reflections</li>
      <li>Tap responses to daily prompts</li>
      <li>Notification preferences and settings</li>
      <li>Resistance level configuration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No data is synced to any cloud service. No data leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>shin. does not integrate any third-party analytics, tracking, advertising, or crash reporting SDKs. We use no external services to monitor your usage or behavior.</p>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions and one-time purchases are processed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID. All transaction processing is handled by Apple according to their <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
    <p>shin. uses local notifications to deliver prompts and reminders. All notification content is generated on your device. No notification data is transmitted to any external server. You can disable notifications at any time through your device settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Natural Language Processing</h2>
    <p>shin. uses Apple's on-device NaturalLanguage framework for optional text analysis features. All processing happens locally on your device. No text or analysis results are transmitted externally.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any user data to third parties. There is no data to share — we simply don't have it.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data at all times. To delete all app data, simply uninstall shin. from your device. No residual data remains on any external server, because no data was ever sent to one.</p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>shin. is not directed at children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, contact us at:<br>
